# appimagetool

This is an experimental implementation of the AppImage command line tool, `appimagetool`, in Go, mainly to see what is possible. It can also do, using the `deploy` verb, what [linuxdeployqt](https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt) does.

## Installation and usage

Assuming you are using a 64-bit Intel machine (amd64, also known as x86_64), you can use our pre-compiled binaries. To try it out:

```bash
wget -c https://github.com/$(wget -q https://github.com/probonopd/go-appimage/releases/expanded_assets/continuous -O - | grep "appimagetool-.*-x86_64.AppImage" | head -n 1 | cut -d '"' -f 2)
chmod +x appimagetool-*.AppImage
./appimagetool-*.AppImage -s deploy ./AppDir/usr/share/applications/*.desktop # Bundle EVERYTHING
# or 
./appimagetool-*.AppImage deploy ./AppDir/usr/share/applications/*.desktop # Bundle everything expect what comes with the base system
# and
VERSION=1.0 ./appimagetool-*.AppImage ./AppDir # turn AppDir into AppImage
```

<https://github.com/probonopd/go-appimage/releases/tag/continuous> has builds for 32-bit Intel, 32-bit ARM (e.g., Raspberry Pi), and 64-bit ARM.

### Recognized env vars

- `QTDIR`: root directory for the Qt installation to copy shared libraries from, e.g. `/usr/lib/qt6/`
